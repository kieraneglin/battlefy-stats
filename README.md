# battlefy-stats

A super fun project to familiarize myself with Angular!

# To use

Clone, run `npm install`, then set an env variable with the key 'LOL_KEY' and the value being your LoL API Key.

If using heroku to deploy, you can set a variable with `heroku config:set LOL_KEY=xxxxxxxxx`.  However, you'll have to run the server using `heroku local`
